minimum_silence_length=1000 # honestly not as sure why you'd change this one
silence_threshold=-40 # lower value if it's cutting out too much, higher value if it's not cutting out enough. Yes it is supposed to be negative
buffer_time=500 # it's goot to have some silent gaps surrounging the useful sound so it doesn't sound jittery
