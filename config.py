minimum_silence_length=1000 # honestly not as sure why you'd change this one
silence_threshold=-40 # lower value if it's cutting out too much, higher value if it's not cutting out enough. Yes it is supposed to be negative
buffer_time=500 # it's goot to have some silent gaps surrounging the useful sound so it doesn't sound jittery
debug_mode=False # Set to true if you want to keep all temporary files as well as the silent portions. Might be helpful for debugging or if you want those files for video editing
